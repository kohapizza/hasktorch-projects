mcaffee IS malware
I love playing tapped out because it is fun to watch the town grow by earning money and buying buildings.  I love helping my neighbors, too.
I love this flashlight app!  It really illuminates the dark, very cool!  Get this app, you will love it, really!
One of my favorite games
Cute game. I am not that good at it but my kids are. We love Nik Wallenda!
Made me think , variety of the puzzles kept it fun to play. I am glad I gave this one a chance.  Looking forward to the next update

Not sure what else can be said about Norton products. I have used them for years on all my desk and laptop computers. Easy to install and protects my hard-drives well. Not sure I see what one of the other reviewers stated about upsells from Norton (haven't seen them yet even after almost 3 weeks of daily use). Anyway, if you are looking for Antivirus software that can be easily installed on three of your devices, this is for you.
Save your money and purchase a good (i.e. Norton) security for your PC. Too many issues with this version. I have not tried the newer editions since I was so burned by this one, but I do see where the latest edition is $20 cheaper than this one. So, if you are into gambling and want to try the more recent version, maybe they got rid of all the bugs and glitches in this one. I still would recommend looking elsewhere to protect your pc.
I always use Norton as my PC security application (have for over 10 years). I prefer it to most others as I have never had any issues with worms or viruses. Of course, this 2011 version is now outdated and I would recommend that the intended purchaser go with the 2013 version to be sure to capture all recent updates (I now how the 2013 version of this app already purchased and installed on my HP. Highly recommend the Norton as your security application.
I found the Roxio Creator to be too difficult to work with, with issues occurring on and off all the time (bugs for sure). I couldn't get the editing down on this application, so I was never able to fully utilize it. I did however, use it fo video transfers which did seem to work well. Anyway, in looking at the other reviews out here it looks like others have had the same troubles I have had. Maybe with the 2013 version Roxio might get it right, but steer clear of the older versions out there.
I had a trial version of Microsoft Office which came with my laptop, so I was in the market for the full blown version that would work with my Vista system. This product was easy to use and install and walked me throught the entire process. I would highly recommend to anyone.
It's a great game,like it has so many types of Dragons. Amazing
For the amount of money, the app is good. BUT the interface leaves a lot to be desired. I have it for Roku so not sure if it's the same on each platform. When doing certain things like searching through your shows, you have to go through every.single.one.of.them. to get to the show you want, instead of having each show in it's own section like other apps. Also, if you are searching through your shows and you click on it and then go back, you go back to the very beginning. When looking through 'recorded shows', you scroll through a ton then you can hit see more and again it takes you back to the beginning. The show selection is good and I am happy with that part of it but it gets old doing all the scrolling when they could improve the interface and make it a lot easier to see what you have to watch. Also, you cannot always find shows in the search section, it is odd and another one of Frndly's weird features.
Cheaper to buy the amazon upgrade versus paining Apple's high price.<br />to be honest I wonder at times why I do this every year. the features really aren't any better each year. I don't have a lot backed up but do have some.<br />I haven't hung a website up so why?<br />keeps an email available to me, my wife and daughter to communicate with. Yes I have gmail and hotmail but both have been spammed and taken over even w/ password changes.<br />so i pay the fee and upgrade thanks to amazon
fun app
not that good a much better app is  Cross Stitch World
Been playing in anticipation of a Vegas trip.  Both blackjack and slots.  Earning free buffet trips, discounted shows a d rooms without spending a dime.
Fun!!!!
Lot of fun but can be very frustrating only because I'm a Moron @ times while playing the game.Made me laugh @ myself and try harder.Just a fun SIMPLE. game.
YES PLANNING MY 30 day tomorrow
My favorite music app.
Bought it at Best Buy. Best gadget in awhile. Way to go Amazon;
Love these free channels I can get with my Firestick.
I like this game ok... but wish there were less that you must purchase.  Eh.  I'll play until I get tired of the pay for this, pay for that.  Eh.  Wish it could be the good old days and you could play a game for fun.
The app works... but... in general I just don't think there is enough content to justify the additional streaming costs.  I haven't found a single show that would make me think I needed to pay more.  Plus, I don't really appreciate that they make you pay to see some shows - new and/or reruns.  Eh.  I already pay way enough for my satellite subscription.  So, once my trial use is over - I'll cancel.
I downloaded this app to my firestick and it works perfectly.  Love the access to all my streaming stuff AND my paid dish account.  Couldn't be happier.  Very easy to set up and use - step by step process that even I could do all by myself without the help of 10 year old grandson.  Win!
Mom (80 years old) likes to play mahjong type games and she chose this one.  I hate ads, but it what happens when you get a free app.  But it is time spender and Mom likes that it exercises her mind.
As time blowers go, this is a casino game crossed with a scrabble like word game.  It's a step up I think.  Fairly good win ratio.  Why only 4 stars... you gotta be hooked up to wifi.  *eh*  You're not always able to wifi when you've got down time... I have it on a samsung tablet and on a kindle.  It doesn't freeze or crash or at least not so far - I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.
drags and crashes fairly regularly on my kindle- which bums grandson seriously.  I will keep looking. I just wish when you go to the kindle app store, the apps would work really well on any kindle.
It's a bit jerky and I do have to really work to get to a place I need to get to... so maybe not super intuitive for older folks?  Everyday I work with it though in order to get the most out of my Alexa.  If you order Alexa you will have to use this app.  *note: I am using the app on my android device... it might work more easily with one of my kindles, however, it's still a bit more difficult to navigate than I would like.  I am certain they will improve it.
Yeah.  If you like the movie, you're gonna love this slots game.  I have found it's a little tight.. but the graphics and story makes it a great time waster.  Also, you do NOT have to have internet connection to play.  It doesn't freeze or shut down.  So far, I like it.
It's a great way to search an area for sale or rent...  You can set the notifications which is useful.  If you looking to buy or rent, I recommend it.
UPDATE 3/17/2018 AVOID ALL ZYNGA games. If they decide to &#34;end&#34; a game - all the purchases you make in game are gone... not to mention any and all tokens.  What a HUGE ripoff.  BOYCOTT ZYNGA.  Unless you don't care about money.  Soooo disappointed.<br />UPDATE....9/8/2016...  I have REPEATEDLY attempted to contact the developer to inform them that you cannot click on and review ads for the 3 million tokens.  It freezes and/or shuts down every device I have it loaded on....  a kindle fire....an LG 4 smart phone.....  It is SUPER frustrating because I have sent all the asked for info.  And yet... nothing gets fixed.  Honestly, it's not worth the hassle... it WAS a sort of fun time waster... Now it's just a waste of time.  Shame on the developer.  And if you've bought ad time on this game... guess what? NO ONE is seeing it.  Grrrrrr  Worse???  This is AN AMAZON APP!!!  Amazon?? WHERE ARE YOU???
SUPER SUPER tight.... Buying tokens didn't help.  REQUIRES you to allow it access to your facebook if you want to &#34;register&#34;.... otherwise you play as an anonymous guest EVEN if you buy tokens.  Frankly, I would pass unless you like selling your facebook ad space and selling out all your friends and family.
Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens<br />Down side....<br />1. SUPER tight payouts... (cause they want you to buy tokens, right?) but that makes you less likely to play<br />2.  Once a day &#34;gift&#34; tokens... VERY small - most of the time used in 2 spins<br />3.  They bring in new games and then take them away... so far, the really fun games!<br />4.  A bunch of &#34;high roller&#34; games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens, so they are a waste<br />5.  Even after &#34;buying&#34; tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens.<br />6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34;account&#34; so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail, &#34;We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34;  - or any other email.<br />So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall.<br />BEWARE of &#34;unhelpful&#34; votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.
lots of ads.... but it hasn't crashed my kindle hd yet... so I will keep it.  The ads actually interrupt your game which is REALLY annoying, in fact almost a deal breaker for me.  I don't &#34;purchase&#34; in game so the ads come along with the deal. It never really lets you get &#34;ahead&#34;... perhaps if you &#34;buy&#34; the tokens it might let you win more?  I am on the fence.  If I run out of tokens, I will just uninstall.  I will say that some of the slots available are sort of interesting... others are incredibly boring.  Something for everyone I guess.
I like Amazon music with prime much better than Pandora... it's FREE (with Prime).  Now... if it were as easy to use as Pandora and others, it would 5 star.  I love that it doesn't limit the skip forwards... you can still rate the songs... and there are SO many choices.  Just ANOTHER reason to get prime, every year.
This is a pretty easy game... but I like it.  I also put it with my grandson's game list on my cell as he really enjoys this type of puzzle/think games.  I have a LG G4 and so far, no issues.  I will update if there are any problems.
I have to admit that I was one of those who jumped ship WAY back when they decided to raise the prices SO much.  I had the get the DVD in the mail type account.  After a fair amount of time and improvements in service, I've returned for the streaming.  I do really love the access on the Fire Stick.  AND I hear that Netflix will begin being available at Marriotts.  That is perfect for me as I travel a LOT I stay exclusively at Marriotts for the points.  Win..win.
I have a kindle HD... so far it hasn't crashed... but the sound is a bit wanky on some of the sounds... I would give it an additional star for better quality sound and less obvious looping - making the sounds longer so you can't figure the pattern... Some of the sounds are just awful... what they call &#34;air conditioning&#34; sounds like blasting jet engines to me.  But if that is &#34;white noise&#34; for you, you'll love it.  The cat purring is pretty cool - if you have a cat or miss your cat... Wish the &#34;chimes&#34; was not so sharp --- a deeper tone. There are &#34;adjustments&#34; but they aren't quite enough to make the sounds comfortable.  You could possibly wake the dead with the sharp tones of the &#34;chimes&#34; -plus the loop on this one is way too short.... Anyway... I pretty sure there's something for everyone.  It's all personal preference. I dislike that just leaving the app doesn't turn it off.  You have to actually chose &#34;exit&#34; on a drop down list.  Anyway... For the sounds and use as &#34;white&#34; noise&#34;....I recommend giving it a try and decide for yourself.
Nope.  Not only did it NOT work... it messed up my fire remote causing Amazon to send a replacement.  What a drag.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S5.  Too bad they encourage you in the Fire Stick tutorial to &#34;pair&#34; your android/iphone to your stick.  What a big mess.  Not a fan.<br />*However... after remote was replaced, the Fire Stick works well.. just remember you must be connected to really strong, reliable internet for streaming or face the constant &#34;slow internet&#34; popup.....
Honestly, this is probably a game meant for the 8-10 year range... so I am a BIT beyond their &#34;target&#34; age.  That being said... I like the mind numbing quality and the distraction of it.  You &#34;accept&#34; rescue animals, feed, treat, care for them and then they are adopted or released.  It's time management, although there is no penalty and task juggling. You can accumulate pretend $$ that allow you to &#34;purchase&#34; other items, yard decor, etc... I don't notice any annoying app habits (ads, contstant reminder pop-ups - etc).  I think it does drain a bit of your battery... but I usually don't play it that long.  I also have a task killer to be sure it's off when I'm done as with all apps.  Honestly, it's good, easy fun.  I hope they will itroduce new animals as time goes on and new care options.  I got this as a free app of the day, however, it would be worth a buck or two to me otherwise. Happy brain break to all!
got this game for those moments when I have to sit for a minute or two... it's fun... maybe alittle complicated but still fun.  I actually got this for my 4 year old grandson to work on with me.  We like to laugh together and this definitely works in that world.
Ahhhh... there is only one tune and once you do it successfully I guess you just keep doing the same thing to beat your last time?? It would be cool if there were a dozen different tunes... different levels... increasing the challenge?  I think it could be a lot more fun... it's just not to me....I just uninstalled it.
This is great if you have a few minutes to waste, this is a great game.... you tap the matching icons... I was confused for just a second trying to slide the icons to match them. I have this loaded on my kindle fire HDX and my samsung galaxy 5. No problems so far.
The puzzles are Xmas themed as you would expect. There is a small ad bar on bottom of screen that isn't annoying. The games are very easy but it does offer a hint before you 'hang'. I think this would be fun for 8-10yrs. Probably too easy for adults but if you are looking for a holiday time blower this is a good one. You can register and track highest scores. Nice that you aren't asked to buy more stuff as you're playing.
Overall, I pretty much am not in love with Facebook, but if you want to keep in touch with the youngsters in your family, you've got to do facebook... which means getting the app too.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 and it seems to work. But I do prefer to access Facebook from my computer.  Easier to see all the options.
Sadly this game crashed my phone every single time I tried to use it.... Samsung Galaxy5...
I travel Alaska multiple times a year.  App works and is useful.  I haven't had any issues with it.  NOTE: if you purchase a &#34;vacation package&#34; on the website, the app will not help you with your seats or other changes.. you will have to call the &#34;vacation specialists&#34; for that still. Will move to 5 stars once they can add that.
